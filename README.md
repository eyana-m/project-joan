# Project Joan
Trace business requirements with system features and agreements in one view. No need to waste time backtracking multiple documents and emails.

Named after [Joan Holloway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Holloway) from Mad Men. In the show, Joan handles all clerical and administrative work at the advertising agency Sterling Cooper Draper Price.
